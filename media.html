      <div class="media_subtitle">
        <h3>Media is a very powerful tool. What we consume subconciously influences how we see the world.
        Historically and contemporarily, the portrayal of dark skin people in media has been...questionable to say the least.
       There are a couple of tropes and themes that can be seen in the media that we consume that has colorist undertones.

        <h3>The "Ghetto" Dark Skin Friend:</h3>
        <p class="explan_txt">This trope of the "loud" and "ghetto" dark skin friend is very common in media. Typically
        there is a light skin "main" character who is seen as pretty, smart, nice. And she usually has a dark skin
        friend who is usually "loud" and constantly the butt of the jokes. This trope was especially popular in
        90's shows such as "Martin." This trope also follows in cartoons meant for kids like "The Proud Family." In this trope,
        the dark skin friend only exsists to make the lightskin friend look good. The dark skin friend experiences no character development
        and they only exsist to be the butt of every joke.

        <h3>Skin Lightening and "Brightening"</h3>
        <p class="explan_txt">
        Skin lightening, also known as skin bleaching is what you typically think of
        when you think about colorism. All over the world people are belaching their skin to fit the goal of having light skin.
        In Asia, skin lightening advertisements are very prominant. In Asian countries like Korea skin whitening is a normal
        activity that people part take in. In India there is a brand called "fair and lovley" (pictured) that famously makes bleaching products.
        In the Caribbean and Africa, there are multiple celebrities who are open about bleaching their skin. Vybz Kartel (pictured), a Jamaican
        artist has a popular song called "Cake Soap" where he talks about skin lightening. Meanwhile in the United States, you will not see overt advertiseing for skin bleaching
        however, in skincare, people are constantly seeking skin "brightening" products, which a lot of times, just lightens the skin.

        <h3>Dark Skin Husband, Light Skin Wife:</h3>
        <p class="explan_txt">The dark skin husband and light skin wife is a trope that is seen throughout televison.
          Historically, dark skin is seen as aggressive and masculine,these are characteristics that work in the favor of dark skin men.
          The association of dark skin as being aggressive, does not work in favor for women, who are expected to be seen as "light" and "dainty."
          Because of this, you will usually see a dark skin man, paired with a light skin women, to "balance" out his "aggression". Typically this man is also considered "successful."
          Part of the "success package" in black media, is being able to have your "trophy" light skin wife on your arm.

          <h3>Recasting/Miscasting Dark Skin Characters:</h3>
          <p class="explan_txt">
            In hollywood, a lot of times when a book is turned to a movie, or a show is remade, a lot of times, they
            will recast the dark skin character in the book and make them light skin. Or, if a dark skin actor leaves the show, they recast them as a light skin actress.
            Famously, Aunt Viv from the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" was recasted when the actress left the show. The actress they replaced with and actress who was significantly lighter.
            When the novel "The Hate You Give" was turned into a movie, instead of casting a dark skin acrtess, like portrayed on the cover of the novel, they casted Amandla
            Steinberg, a light skin actress, to play a role meant for a dark skin girl. Additonally, When Avatar the Last AirBender was turned into a live adaptation, the actress
            who plays Katara is significantly lighter than how the character is dark in the tv show.

          <h3>The Paper Bag Test:</h3>
          <p class="explan_txt"> Historically, in countries like the United States, South Africa etc, there was this test called "the paper bag test", this test was used to see how dark someone was.
            Black fraternities and sorotities along with different organizations used a brown paper bag as a measure of who was allowed to be a part of their clubs, parties and organizations.
            Although now people are not holding up paper bags to say who can be on tv shows, it is not a coincidence that every popular black girl on television right now can pass the paper
            bag test. There is a shortage of young dark skin actresses in hollywood getting consistent work.
             Child acrtress like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Xn2RVOlcY">Coco Jones</a> from the hit Disney show "Let It Shine" alluded to her being over
             looked for roles that were eventually given to her lighter counter part, Zendaya.
