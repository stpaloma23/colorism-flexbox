          Colorism is a result of colonization. Colorism plays a role in every single community that has a history of European colonization. Historically, these societies have shown a preference for lighter skin tones. Because it is associated with being closer to whiteness, which is associated with power, wealth and beauty.
            Historically, lighter skin has been seen as a survival method that allowed people to get better jobs and to have a higher standing in society. In certain Asian countries, dark skin was synonymous with the lower class people who worked the fields. In the United States, light-skinned people
            were given better jobs and more opportunities for social mobility. Colorism continues to play a role in our society, even up to the <a href="media.html">media</a> we consume. Colorism has been engrained so perfectly into every aspect of our society, that we often overlook it.
